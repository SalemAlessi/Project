    <div class="Steam-Plant">
    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-square-info"></i>Steam (Thermal) Power Plant</h2>
    <h2>Fuel:Coal or Oil. Main Parts: Boiler, Turbine,Generator. </h2>
    <ul>
        <div><li class="list1">Coal and Ash circuit</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulverised coal from the storage area (called stack) is taken to the boiler by means of coal handling equipment such as belt conveyors, bucket elevators etc.</li>
            <li>After the pulverised coal is burnt at 15000C to 20000C by combustion it gets collected in the ash pit.</li>
            <li>It is removed from the ash pit by ash handling systems like belt conveyors, screw conveyors etc.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        
       
        <div><li  class="list1">Air and Flue Gas Circuit</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The air from the atmosphere gets heated in the air preheater. The air receives its heat from the hot flue gases passing to the chimney</li>
            <li>The hot air enters the boiler and helps in combustion of fuel in the boiler.</li>
            <li>The flue gases, after combustion in the boiler furnace, pass around the boiler tubes, heating the water present in the tubes.</li>
            <li>The flue gases then pass through a dust collector which removes any dust or solid particles</li>
            <li>The filtered flue gas passes through the economiser and preheater and is forced out through the chimney by a draught fan.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div><li  class="list1" >Feed water and Steam Circuit</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The superheated steam from the boiler enters the steam turbine. The superheated steam temperature is about 6000C at a pressure of 30 Mpa(300 kg/cm2)</li>
            <li>The steam expands in the turbine causing the turbine blades to rotate. After doing mechanical work on the blades and loosing its energy, the steam becomes wet and the pressure of steam becomes less.</li>
            <li>The wet steam passes through a condenser where it completely becomes water. The condensed water that has a temperature of 300C to 400C is collected in a tank called hot well.</li>
            <li>The water from the hot well is fed into the boiler through the economiser.</li>
            <li>The economiser preheats the water before entering the boiler. The economiser receives its heat from the flue gases leaving the boiler</li>
            <li>Preheating the feed water in the economiser increases the boiler efficiency and helps quicker production of steam.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div><li  class="list1" >Cooling Water Circuit</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Water is circulated around the condenser to condense the steam comming out of the turbine.</li>
            <li>Cooling water enters the condenser at 100C to 150C and leaves at 200C to 250C.</li>
            <li>Plenty of water is required for condensing the steam in the condenser. The water may be taken from sources such as river or lake.</li>
        </ol>

    <ul> <h3>Advatages and Disadvatages of thermal power plant</h3>
        <h4>Advatages of thermal power plant</h4>
        <li>Low initial cost</li>
        <li>Since located near the load centre, the cost of transmission and the losses due to transmission are considerably reduced.</li>
        <li>The construction and commissioning of thermal power plant takes lesser period.</li>

        <h4>Disadvatages of thermal power plant</h4>
        <li>Fuel is a non-renewable source of energy. </li>
        <li>Efficiency decreases with decreasing load. </li>
        <li>Cost of power generation is high.</li>
        <li>Smoke produced by burning the fuel causes air pollution.</li>
        <li>Life of thermal power plant is 25 years. The efficiency decreases to less than 10% after its life period.</li>
        <li>Turbines has a high running speed of 3000 to 4000 rpm</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="Gas-Turbine">
        <div>
            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-fire-flame-simple" id="flame"></i>Gas Turbine</h2>
            <h3>Working Principle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Air is compressed to high pressure by a fan-like device called the compressor.</li>
                <li>Then fuel and compressed air are mixed in a combustion chamber and ignited.</li>
                <li>Hot gases are given off, which spin the turbine wheels.</li>
                <li>Most of the turbine’s power runs the compressor. Part of it drives the generator/machinery</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div><h3>Description</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gas turbines burn fuels such as oil, nature gas and pulverised(powdered) coal.</li>
                <li>Instead of using the heat to produce steam, as in steam turbines, gas turbines use the hot gases directly to turn turbine blades.</li>
                <li>Gas turbines have three main parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Air compressor</li>
                        <li>Combustion chamber</li>
                        <li>Turbine</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul></div>    
            
            <div><h4>Air Compressor</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The air compressor and turbine are mounted horizontal at either end on a common axle(shaft), with the combustion chamber between them</li>
                <li>Gas turbines are not self starting. A starting motor initially drives the compressor till the first combustion of fuel takes place, later, part of the turbine’s power runs the compressor.</li>
                <li>The air compressor sucks in air and compresses it, thereby increasing its pressure.</li>
            </ul></div>
            
            <div> <h4>Combustion Chanber</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In the combustion chamber, the compressed air combines with fuel and the resulting mixture is burnt.</li>
                <li>The greater the pressure of air, the better the fuel air mixture burns.</li>
                <li>Modern gas turbines usually use liquid fuel, but they may also use gaseous fuel, natural gas or gas produced artificially by gasification of a solid fuel.</li>
            </ul></div>
           <div><h4>Turbine</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The burning gases expand rapidly and rush into the turbine, where they cause the turbine wheels to rotate.</li>
                <li>Hot gases move through a multistage gasturbine.</li>
                <li>Like in steam turbine, the gas turbine also has fixed(stationary) and moving(rotor) blades.</li>
                <li>The stationary blades guide the moving gases to the rotor blades and adjust its velocity.</li>
                <li> The shaft of the turbine is coupled to a generator or machinery to drive it.</li>
            </ul></div>
            
            <div> <h4>Application of Gas Turbine</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gas turbines are used to drive pumps</li>
                <li>Used in aircraft and ships for their propulsion. They are not suitable for automobiles because of their very high speeds.</li>
                <li>Power generation(used for peak load and as stand-by unit).</li>
             </ul></div>

                             <li>Nuclear power generation does emit relatively low amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). The emissions of green house gases and therefore the contribution of nuclear power plants to global warming is therefore relatively little.</li>
                             <li>This technology is readily available, it does not have to be developed first.</li>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>Energy cannot be be created or destroyed, but its form can  change.
                   To generate electricity, water must be in motion. This is kinetic
                   energy. When flowing water turns blades in a turbine, the form
                   is changed to mechanical energy.
                   The turbine turns the generator rotor which then converts this
                   mechanical energy into an electric energy (electricity). Since
                   water is the initial source of energy, we call this hydroelectric
                   power or hydropower for short</p>

                 <div><h2><i class="fa-solid fa-wind" id="wind"></i>Wind Turbine power plant</h2>
                   <p>Wind is a form of solar energy. The kinetic energy of the wind can be changed into other forms of energy, energy, either liking mechanical energy or electrical sailing boat. In former time a windmill grinds or mills grain.</p>
                   <h3>How wind turbine works</h3>
                   <p>The blades of the turbine are attached to a hub that is mounted on a turning shaft. The shaft goes through a gear transmission box where the turning speed is increased. The transmission is attached to a high speed shaft which turns a generator that makes electricity.</p>
                   <h3>Advatages of wind Energy</h3>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Wind energy is fueled by the wind, so it's a clean fuel source.</li>
                       <li>Wind energy is actually a form of solar energy, which can't be used up.</li>
                       <li>Wind energy is one of the lowest-priced renewable energy technologies available today</li>
                       <li>Wind turbines can be built on farms or ranches, thus benefiting the economy in rural areas</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Disadvatages Of Wind Energy</h3>
                   <ul>
                       <li>requires a higher initial investment than fossil-fueled generators</li>
                       <li>The wind is intermittent and it does not always blow when electricity is needed.</li>
                       <li>Good wind sites are often located in remote locations, far from cities where the electricity is needed</li>
                       <li>Although wind power plants have relatively little impact on the environment ,there is some concern over the noise produced by the rotor blades, aesthetic (visual) impacts, and sometimes birds have been killed by flying into the rotors.</li>

                    <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-droplet" id="droplet"></i>Geothermal power plant</h2>
                   <p>Heat from the Earth, or geothermal — Geo(Earth) + thermal (heat) — energy can be and already is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil. Geothermal energy is an enormous, underused heat and power resource that is clean (emits little or no greenhouse gases), reliable (average system availability of 95%), and homegrown (making us less dependent on foreign oil).</p>
