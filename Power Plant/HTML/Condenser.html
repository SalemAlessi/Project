            <p><b>condenser</b> is a heat exchanger used to condense a gaseous substance into a liquid state through cooling. In so doing, the latent heat is released by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Condensers can be either:-</li>
                <ol>
                <li>Under-slung</li>
                <p>Under-slung condensers have the advantage of easy access for inspection and repair, particularly if the condenser needs to be flooded on the steam side to test for leaks.</p>
                <li>End-slung</li>
                <p>End-slung condensers have the advantage of reducing the overall height of the turbine unit and allowing easier alignment with the propeller shaft.</p>

            <h2>What The Daltons'S Law Of partial Pressure</h2>
            <p> The total pressure exerted by mixture of gases or a mixture of gas and vapors (which have no chemical action on each other) is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the constituents of the mixture, if it occupies the volume of mixture at temperature of mixture</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The total pressure in the condenser is the sum of the partial pressure of steam and air.</li>
                <li>Pressure of mixture= partial pressure of steam + partial pressure of air.</li>
                <li>TSo according to Daltons law total pressure in the condenser is, Pc = Ps + Pa </li>
                <li>Pc= total pressure in condenser  ,

        <h1>Steam Condenser</h1>
        <p>A steam condenser is a closed vessel in to which the steam is exhausted, and condensed after doing work in an engine cylinder or turbine.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A steam condenser has the following two object:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The primary object is to maintain a low pressure (below atmospheric pressure) so as to obtain maximum possible energy from steam and thus to secure high efficiency.</li>
                <li>The secondary object is to supply pure feed water to the hot well, from where it is pumped back to boiler.</li>

    <div class="Surface-Condenser">
        <h2>What The Surface Condenser?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A surface condenser has a great advantages over
                the jet condenser, as the condensate does not
                mix up with cooling water</li>
            <li>It consist of a horizontal cast iron cylindrical
                vessel packed with tubes, through which the
                cooling water flows.</li>
            <li>The end of the condensers are cut off by vertical
                perforated types of plates in to which water
                tubes are fixed.</li>
            <li>This is done in such a manner that the leakage of
                water into the centre condensing space is
                prevented.</li>
            <li>The water tubes pass horizontally through the
                main condensing space for the steam.</li>
            <li>The steam enters at the top and is forced to
                flow down words over the tubes due to the
                suction of the extraction pump at the bottom</li>
            <li>The cooling water flows in one direction
                through the lower half of the tubes and
                returns in opposite direction through the
                upper half.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="Air-Leakage">
        <h2>What The Source Of Air Leakage?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The following are main sources through which the air may enter in to the condenser.
                <ol>
                    <li>The dissolved air in the feed water enters in to
                        the boiler, which in turn enters in to the
                        condenser with exhaust steam.</li>
                    <li>The air leaks in to the condenser, through various joint, due to high vacuum pressure in the condenser.</li>
                    <li>In case of jet condensers , dissolved air with the injection water enters in to the condenser</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What The Effect Of Air Leakage?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It reduces vacuum pressure in the condenser.</li>
            <li>Since air is poor heat conductor, particularly at low densities, it reduces the rate of heat transmission.</li>
            <li>It requires a larger air pump. Moreover, an increased power is required power is required to drive the pump. </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="Efficiency">
        <h2>What The condenser Efficiency?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The condenser efficiency may be defined as the ratio of temperature rise of cooling water to the vacuum temperature minus inlet cooling water temperature.</li>
            <li>ᶯc = temperature rise of cooling water/(vacuum temperature- inlet cooling water temperature)</li>
            <li>ᶯc = (to - ti ) / (tv-ti)</li>
            <ol>
                <li>ᶯc = (to - ti ) / (tv-ti)</li>
                <li>Where ,to= outlet temperature of cooling water.</li>
                <li>ti= inlet temperature of cooling water.</li>
                <li>tv= vacuum temperature</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>What The Vacuum Efficiency?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The minimum absolute pressure (also called as ideal
                pressure) at the steam inlet of a condenser is the
                pressure corresponding to the temperature of the
                condensed steam.</li>
            <li>The corresponding vacuum (called ideal vacuum) is the
                maximum vacuum that can be obtained in a
                condensing plant, with no air present at that
                temperature.</li>
            <li>The pressure in the actual condenser is greater than
                the ideal pressure by an amount equal to the pressure
                of air present in the condenser.</li>
            <li>The ratio of the actual vacuum to the ideal vacuum is
                known as vacuum efficiency.</li>
                <li>ᶯv= actual vacuum /ideal vacuum</li>
                <li>Actual vacuum= barometric pressure-actual pressure.</li>
                <li>Ideal vacuum = barometric pressure-ideal pressure</li>            
        </ul>

    <div class="Cooling-Tower">
        <h2>What The Cooling Tower?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The main application are in power plants and refrigeration plants.</li>
            <li>Its function is to cool the hot water from the condenser by exposing it to the atmospheric air, so that the cold water may be used again for circulation.</li>
            <li>The cooling towers are used in steam power plants where there is a limited supply of cooling water.</li>
            <li>It is placed at a certain height (at about 9 meters from the ground level).</li>
            <li>The hot water falls down in radial sprays from a height and the atmospheric air enters from the base of tower.</li>
            <li>The partial evaporation of water takes place which reduces the temperature of circulating water.</li>
            <li>This cooled water is collected in the pond at the base of the tower and pumped in to the condenser.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Type Of Cooling Tower</li> 
            <ol> 
                <li>Natural Draft Cooling Tower</li>
                <p>The circulation of air is produced by the pressure difference of air inside and outside the cooling tower.</p>
                <li>Forced Draft Cooling Tower</li>
                <p>The circulation of air is produced by means of fans placed at the base of tower.</p>
                <li>Induced Draft Cooling Tower</li>
                <p>The circulation of air is provided by means of fan placed at top of tower.</p>
